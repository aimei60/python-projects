#tests: will use mocking and patch testing due to user and print statements
#test 1: if top number is less than 0
#test 2: top number isdigit
#test 3: if random number prints out 1 number
#test 4: user guesses return 1 work for user_guess > number:
#test 5: user guesses return 1 work for user_guess < number:
#test 6: user guess == number gueses return 1
